### Theme: Stock Price Prediction Model Construction

#### Task Overview

In this training, you will build a time-series prediction model using NTT's stock price data. Starting with exploratory data analysis (EDA), you will proceed to model evaluation to verify the prediction accuracy using machine learning. The goal is to apply this to real-world business scenarios.

#### Estimated Work

- **Duration**: 1 week
- **Work Hours**: 12 to 20 hours
- **Suggested Timeline**:
  - **2 hours**: Understanding the data and conducting EDA.
  - **2 hours**: Data preprocessing and feature engineering.
  - **1 hour**: Model selection and training.
  - **1 hour**: Model evaluation and result analysis.
  - **4-8 hours**: Refining the model and retraining.
  - **2-6 hours**: Summarizing the results and creating presentation materials.

#### Task Details

1. **Understanding the Data and EDA**
   - **Overview**: Use NTT’s stock price data to check basic statistics, identify time-series trends and seasonality, and detect anomalies.
   - **Objective**: Understand the data trends and extract challenges for building the prediction model.

2. **Data Preprocessing and Feature Engineering**
   - **Overview**: Handle missing values, normalization, scaling, and create features useful for stock price prediction.
   - **Objective**: Prepare the data to improve the accuracy of the model.

3. **Model Selection and Training**
   - **Overview**: Select and implement an appropriate prediction model. Examples include ARIMA models or LSTM recurrent neural networks.
   - **Objective**: Build a model that maximizes stock price prediction accuracy.
   - **Note**: There is no specific model requirement, but be prepared to explain why you chose the model.

4. **Model Evaluation and Result Analysis**
   - **Overview**: Verify the prediction accuracy and calculate evaluation metrics.
   - **Objective**: Objectively evaluate the effectiveness of the model and analyze the results.
   - **Note**: You may choose the evaluation metrics, but be ready to explain the reasons behind your selection.

5. **Model Refinement and Retraining**
   - **Overview**: Identify areas for improvement in the model, incorporate these into a retraining process.
   - **Objective**: Build a higher-accuracy prediction model.
   - **Note**: Summarize the hypothesis behind the improvements and the results in the presentation materials.

6. **Summary of Results and Presentation Material Creation**
   - **Overview**: Compile the outcomes of the training into presentation materials, and report on the model-building process and results in a presentation format.
   - **Objective**: Develop the ability to clearly communicate technical outcomes.

#### Deliverables

1. **Implemented Program**:
   - **Submission Method**: Create a repository on your GitHub account and push the code.
   - **README**: Provide an overview and instructions for running the program.

2. **Presentation Slides**:
